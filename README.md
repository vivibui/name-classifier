# NAME CLASSIFER USING NAIVE BAYES 

In this project, you will use naive bayes to build a baby name classifier. Your classifier will use the features commonly found in names to distinguish whether a name is likely to be given to a baby girl or boy. You'll train your classifier to identify these certain qualities of names and classify new examples based on those qualities.
